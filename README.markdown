Video Canvas
========
Created By: [Travis Berry][1]

Goals/Usage: 
===============
1. write video to canvas element and hide the original
2. pause on starting to draw or on pause click
3. draw comment and annotation
4. on start of video again, the image is saved to the server, and canvas is reset. The annotation is highlighted on the timeline as a mark.
5. on subsequent views of the video, the images are show overlayed with the video, possibly, redrawn as canvas graphics or just statics pngs that are synced.
6. the images are tied to the video with a filename of the timecode
7. video can then be downloaded or watched with annotations added.

Todo:
======================== 

Create ability to save images to server

Add markers to timeline

Load saved files and overlay on video

<del>Type text on video in the same vein as drawing.</del>

Share connection and drawing between accounts and people connected live.

Show poster frame.

Improve clear function and timeout of pause. Shouldn't skip time at all.

<del>Wrap text at a certain box size.</del>

Add text box for people to enter in the width of the text box they are adding.
